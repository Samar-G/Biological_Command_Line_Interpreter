# Biological_Command_Line_Interpreter
Developing a Biological Command Line Interpreter Simulator in python. It will be similar to the cmd in windows, but will take commands that apply some biological operations on biological data.
<br>
The input to your project will be a command to execute along with any parameters the command demands.
